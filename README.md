# Warp 10™ Platform

## Introduction

Warp 10™ is an Open Source Geo Time Series™ Platform designed to handle data coming from sensors, monitoring systems and the Internet of Things.

Geo Time Series™ extend the notion of Time Series by merging the sequence of sensor readings with the sequence of sensor locations. If your data have no location information, Warp 10™ will handle them as regular Time Series.

## Features

The Warp 10™ Platform provides a rich set of features to simplify your work around sensor data.

* Continuum, our collection and storage layer, a Geo Time Series Database
* WarpScript™, a language dedicated to sensor data analysis with more than 800 functions and extension capabilities
* Plasma and Mobius, streaming engines allowing to cascade the Warp 10 Platform with Complex Event Processing solutions and to build dynamic dashboards
* Quasar, a fine grain access control and authorization mechanism
* Runner, a system for scheduling WarpScript program executions on the server side
* [Sensision](https://github.com/senx/sensision), a framework for exposing metrics and pushing them into Warp 10
* Standalone version running on a Raspberry Pi as well as on a beefy server, with no external dependencies
* Distributed version based on Hadoop HBase for the most demanding environments
* Integration with [Pig](https://github.com/senx/warp10-pig), [Spark](https://github.com/senx/warp10-spark2), [Flink](https://github.com/senx/warp10-flink) (yet to be released) and [Storm](https://github.com/senx/warp10-storm) for batch and streaming analysis.

## Getting Help

The team has put lots of efforts into the [documentation](http://www.warp10.io/) of the Warp 10™ Platform, there are still some areas which may need improving, so we count on you to raise the overall quality.

We understand that discovering all the features of the Warp 10™ Platform at once can be intimidating, that's why we've put together a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/warp10-users) we recommend you subscribe to.

Our goal is to build a large community of users to move our platform into territories we haven't explored yet and to make Warp 10™ and WarpScript™ the standards for sensor data and the IoT.

We also suggest you subscribe to our Twitter account [@warp10io](https://twitter.com/warp10io).

## Commercial Support

Should you need commercial support for your projects, [SenX](https://senx.io/) offers support plans which will give you access to the core team developing the platform.
